# ReScript React Flow
ðŸš§ WIP: [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/) bindings for ReScript.

Some basic examples are already working. But still need to figure out: 

- [x] Custom Node
- [ ] Validations
- [ ] Updatable Edge
- [ ] Controls
- [ ] Provider


These are all very simple bindings that needs implementing I just didn't have the time.
They're also a greate exercise if you're learning ReScript. Feel free to contribute.

## Installing
1. Install `rescript-react-flow` using npm:
`npm install --save rescript-react-flow`
or yarn:
`yarn add rescript-react-flow`

2. Add `rescript-react-flow` as dependency to your `bsconfig.json`: 
```json
